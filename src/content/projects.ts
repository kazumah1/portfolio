The system preprocesses noisy neural signals, extracts temporal features, and trains GRU-based encoders with transducer loss to align neural dynamics with phonetic targets. The project emphasizes temporal alignment, robustness under signal sparsity, and decoding stability rather than benchmark optimization.",

Neural speech signals recorded from intracortical arrays are low signal-to-noise and temporally sparse, and small misalignments significantly degrade decoding accuracy. The original work demonstrated that sequence models can map motor cortex activity to text, but training stability and temporal resolution remain core challenges.\n\nOur goal was not to reproduce the paper directly, but to explore alternative sequence modeling strategies and decoding refinements under similar signal constraints."
